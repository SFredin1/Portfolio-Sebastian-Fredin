I am a passionate student at IT-Högskolan hungry for learning. Right now I am studying AI and Machine learning.
I have since I graduated high-school basicly only worked in the manufacturing industry, having logistic type jobs and driving forklifts. I started my programming journey in 2021 while working as a salesman/service-advisor at a car-service company called Mechanum, where I for the first time had to use different systems and programs to order parts, schedule services and reparations. Before this the only experience I had with computers was gaming, but having to use a computer and always sharpen my skills to keep up with the work load was hard in the beginning but was very rewarding the more I learned. It sparked a thought in my head that maybe IT was my way forward in my work life/career. 

At Mechanum I was always impressed of the IT-support guys and their skills with computers and programming. I understood then and there that I needed to move towards a position more like theirs. I had to take up school again and study mathematics and basic programming after work. This took me about a year and a half and then I was ready to apply for a place at IT-Högskolan. I think AI is the future and that's why I chose this course.

I am learning more every day and feel like my potential is high and my limit is only set by myself. I am finally on the right path and more motivated than ever before!
